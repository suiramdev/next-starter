# React

This package offers a production-ready React helper that provides type-safe authentication handling for your React applications.

## Development

### Client-Side 

The `authClient` utility enables type-safe authentication flows in your React application, managing user sessions, authentication states, and API interactions.

```tsx
import { authClient } from "@repo/auth/helpers/react/";
```

#### useSession

The `useSession` hook manages authentication state in your React components, returning the current session status and user information in a type-safe manner.

```tsx
const { session, isLoading } = useSession();
```
